JavaScript package for interacting with LabKey server.

### Goals
The goal for this package is to provide a robust set of JavaScript tools for working with LabKey servers. Our hope is to have it working in the browser, on the server, and in pretty much any modern JavaScript environment.

Written with joy in TypeScript.
